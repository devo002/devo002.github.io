### 3. Semi-Supervised Learning for Image Classification in Visual Inspection of Wound Coils:
-	Implemented the FixMatch semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm with the Dinov2L backbone to accurately classify defects in coil winding datasets, achieving a macro-average F1 score of 90% on the test set.
-	Conducted hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, identifying optimal configurations to maximize model performance.

> **Tech:** PyTorch, SSL, Hugging face, DINOv2-L, FixMatch, MixMatch, Optuna, Tensorboard, Wandb  
> **Role:** Implemented a semi-supervised FixMatch-based multi-label classification pipeline, improving defect detection performance to 90% macro F1, outperforming the fully supervised baseline (87% macro F1).
